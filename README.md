# Machine-Learning-Starter
A basic machine learning code in python explaining the usage of pandas and numpy on any data and some simple models.

In this repository you can check how are the python libraries NumPy and Pandas used in python to handle data in multiple forms showed in excel file format here (titanic.csv), and you can
observe how data is used to train and plot a simple model using regression or classification using scikit-learn and its functionalities.
Make sure to have prior knowledge about the concepts used to create a Machine Learning model as there are various functions for both regression and classification.
feel free to use this repo as u like!!
